# Open Flash CLI

This package provides the Open Flash Command Line Interface tool `ofl`.

Its intent is to provide a way to manipulate SWF files.

## Commands

### Dump

Try to extract most of the data from the SWF file: metadata, tags, bitmaps, bytecode, etc.

Example:

```sh
ofl dump movie.swf movie
```
